        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Who am I?  Why am I here?  What is my purpose in life?  What do I mean by who am I?  Calm down, get a grip now....</p>

        <h2>Really About Me</h2>
		<p>I owe a lot to the Atari 400 that my dad purchased in 1982.</p>

		<p>Unlike most kids around my age, I actually didn't get the games myself, it was my dad who bought the diskettes and swapped games with his buddies.  So I did miss out on this part of the experience to some degree, but I still had a computer to mess around with, type magazine programs into, and experiment with.</p>

		<p>My love of computers led me to the University of Waterloo and their B.Math program.  Five years later I was working as a developer and my career working with computers officially began.</p>

		<p>Between that point and today is a lot of water under the bridge not worth mentioning.  All I'll say is that I (eventually) plan on doing some/all/or barely any of the following:</P>
		<ul>
			<li class='list'>Writing some code that would automatically take baseball data from the web and create an MicroLeague GM disk</li>
			<li class='list'>Creating an updated version of the game that includes some of the more popular advanced metrics (BABIP, FIP, etc.)</li>
			<li class='list'>Porting the Atari800 emulator to the OpenPandora hand held (this has already been done but I'd like to implement my own UI)</li>
			<li class='list'>Creating and documenting original games created using languages such as Action! or TurboBasic XL.</li>
			<li class='list'>Creating my own XL database, using Python and MySQL, that will help me organize my 'collection' online</li>
		</ul>
		<p>All of this is, of course, utter nonsense, because I'll likely start bits here and there and never finish any of it.  But at least I'll remember what I planned on procrastinating for a change...</p>
