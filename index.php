		<p>This website is a vanity project to serve the following purposes (subject to change without notice ;) ):</p>
		<ul class='basic'>
			<li>Keep my web development skills current</li>
			<li>Let me talk about some of the Atari 8BIT projects I have in mind</li>
			<li>Let me brag about some of my Atari 8BIT scores</li>
		</ul>
		<p>But first a bit about me: I owe a lot to the Atari 400 that my dad purchased in 1982.</p>
		<p>Unlike a lot of my peers, I didn't obtain any software illegally.  It was my dad who did - all I did was beat him soundly at pretty much everything he brought home.  I do wish I had been more involved in that side of things, as the BBS scene sounds like it would have been fun, but I got to play all the classics and I have no regrets.</p>
		<p>I don't think my love of typing in magazine listings actually resulted in me successfully getting a game to work, but I did take the first Computer Science class my high school offered and ended up being accepted to the University of Waterloo's B.Math program.  Five-ish years later I was working as a developer and my dream of working with computers that started in 1982 had begun</p>
		<p>Twenty years later here I am,  a bit of time on my hands and an inkling to create my own website, but in need of a topic.  The obvious choice:  pursue my dream of creating *something* associated with <a href='http://www.atarimania.com/game-atari-400-800-xl-xe-micro-league-baseball_3355.html'>Micro League Baseball</a> and document the path I follow.</P>
